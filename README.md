# COMPSYS_302_Project_1 - Car Recogniser
By Eric Zhao and Will Zhang

This repository contains the data loader, models, trainer, and other useful tools for the car recogniser.     
The car recogniser is used to identify the brand of a car from a car image.

# Dependencies
This recogniser require Python 3.6 and Pytorch to be installed.     
Training using GPU is preferred for maximum training speed.
